This code creates a TSV datafile of English words paired with their British
English pronunciation, in IPA transcription.  The words are ordered by frequency
(following Sublex-UK), but words with more than one pronunciation (heteronyms)
are ommited.

I use this to generate a flashcard deck in Anki format, intended to help with
English pronunciation practice.  It's available at:
https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/115334323 .

See the file deck_description.md for information, and check out the generated/
directory for data tables.
